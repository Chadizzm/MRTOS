Porting Guide
=============
Currently can only port to ARM

Step To Port
============
1. Take the port/gcc/m0+ folder and make a copy.
2. Rewrite startup.c which should:
  * Setup interrupt table
  * Define the reset_handler
  * Setup any global variables in the reset_handler
  * Call main in the reset_handler
3. Rewrite the drivers as needed
4. Rewrite main.ld for the ports memory layout
